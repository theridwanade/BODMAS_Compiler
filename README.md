# Welcome to the **BODMAS_Interpreter**

This is a simple interpreter written in **Python**.
Reading this guide will help you understand **compiler theory** in the most minimal and practical way possible — not from textbooks, but from *building it yourself*.

I built this project for one reason: **to understand how compilers think**. And I did.

## Why This is Worth Your Time

Compilers and interpreters are the invisible engines behind everything we do as programmers.
Every line of code you write, from Python to Rust to JavaScript, is understood, broken down, and executed by one of these.

Knowing *how* they work gives you a kind of power that few developers ever touch.
It’s not about immediate rewards or jobs. Honestly, I can’t tell you the reward, all I know is that **it’s incredibly fun**.
There’s something beautiful about watching your own code *understand* other code.

## The Idea

If you’ve ever built a simple calculator app using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, you’ve probably done one of two things:

1. Used a few `if` statements for basic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), or
2. Simply passed the user’s input to JavaScript’s `eval()` function.

That’s fine, I did the same when I built my first calculator.
But I kept wondering: *How can I build a true calculator — one that understands expressions the way a real language does?*

That question led me here.
And the answer was clear: **you do it the compiler way**.

So after reading this guide, I want you to revisit your old calculator project, but this time, **rebuild it the compiler way**.

## Getting Started

To start exploring the interpreter and follow along with this guide, open the main entry file: [**main.py**](./main.py)

That’s where everything begins.

## When You’re Done

If you finish this guide and still don’t fully understand, that’s okay.
Reach out, and I’ll improve the documentation.
Maybe I’ll even explain it personally… though, honestly, I’m not sure I will.

But don’t stop here.
